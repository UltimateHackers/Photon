### Documentation
- [Using Photon](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage)
- [Compatibility & Dependencies](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Compatibility-&-Dependencies)

> Photon is now also available as a [library](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Photon-Library).

## Main Features

#### Data Extraction
Photon extracts the following data while crawling by default:

- URLs (in-scope & out-of-scope)
- URLs with parameters (`example.com/gallery.php?id=2`)
- Intel (emails, social media accounts, amazon buckets etc.)
- Files (pdf, png, xml etc.)
- Secret keys (auth/API keys & hashes)
- JavaScript files & Endpoints present in them
- Strings based on custom regex pattern

The extracted information is saved in an organized manner.\

#### Genius
Crawling can be resource intensive but Photon has some tricks up it's sleeves. You can fetch URLs archived by [archive.org](https://archive.org/) to be used as seeds by using `--wayback` option.\
Liked the idea? The extensive range of [options](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage) provided by Photon lets you crawl the web exactly the way you want.\
Here's a secret, most of the tools floating on the internet aren't properly multi-threaded even if they are supposed to. They either supply a list of items to threads which results in multiple threads accessing the same item or they simply put a thread lock and end up rendering multi-threading useless.\
But Photon is different or should I say "genius"? Take a look at [this](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/blob/8b58580df1bdfe5f7b96eaf83957d018418ec8ae/photon.py#L357-L381) and decide yourself.

#### Ninja Mode
In Ninja Mode, 3 online services are used to make requests to the target on your behalf.\
So basically, now you have 4 clients making requests to the same server simultaneously which gives you a speed boost if you have a slow connection, minimizes the risk of connection reset as well as delays requests from a single client.\
Here's a comparison generated by [Quark](https://github.com/s0md3v/Quark) where the lines represent threads:

#### Plugins
Photon's capabilites can be further extended by using plugins.

Available plugins:

- **[wayback](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#use-urls-from-archiveorg-as-seeds)**: Fetches URLs crawled by archive.org to use as seeds.
- **[dnsdumpster](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#dumping-dns-data)**: Generates an image containing the DNS data of the target domain.
- **[Exporter](https://github.com/s0md3v/Photon/wiki/Usage#export-formatted-result)**: Plugin to export results in JSON, support for more formats is being worked on.

Plugins in active development:

- **Quark**: A plugin to plot a graph making it easier to inspect relationships between different webpages using [Quark](https://github.com/s0md3v/Quark).
- **XSStrike**: Modular & *targeted* version of [XSStrike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike) to be used with Photon.
- **FindSubdomains**: Plugin to find subdomains.

#### Frequent & Seemless Updates
The project is under heavy development and updates for fixing bugs. optimizing performance & new features are being rolled everyday.

If you would like to see features and issues that are being worked on, you can do that on [Development]() project board.

Updates can be installed & checked for with the `--update` option. Photon has seamless update capabilities which means you can update Photon without losing any of your saved data.
